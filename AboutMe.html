			<h3>Education History</h3>
		<p>I went to Our World Neighborhood Charter School elementary/middle school. I was what you'd call a "big deal". Everytime I'd walk into class everyone would stand a applaud me. The teacher always had a four course meal ready for me. Once my English teacher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uriXIjs5U18">didn't</a> have enough time to prepare my queen sized bed that I have in every room, so unfortunetly she was executed.</p>
		<p>Later on I went to ACTvF. The building was a decent size, almost as big as my townhouse in France. I gained many devoted followers, such as Jackline Chandelier, Maria Salimi, Micheal Seviya, Isiah Roller, and Tahleeky Leeky, during my time here. The hardest thing I have trouble with here is finding a place to park my porch, but luckily for me my butler Jackie poo is there for me. Life is truly hard.</p>

	<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>Every morning I have to use my phone the second I wake up. My phone is connected to my heart and if I don't use it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuPQHxA0TVI">every</a> hour, my heart will self destruct. It happened to my grandmother, god rest her soul, and we had to clean her off the walls. (that's a joke, I love my grandma)</p>
